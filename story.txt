It was a Saturday, one forgot to place a alarm that early for a saturday morning!
In fact, the night before he checked for alarms, but they are only setted for week days!

Fortunately, however, the person woke up just in time. It was difficult to wake up at that point, but they did it and started their day.

Now he checked out his calendar. He had a lot of homework to do, but he did not care, because there was something more important for him to do right now.

He needed to put his life in order. So he set his schedule for the day. He first went paid his standing traffic violation fines. Then he set meet time with his advisor.
